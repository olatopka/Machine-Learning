# Machine Learning 
Project Description
The aim of this project is to utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze data about companies and mobile phone models in order to predict their prices. 
The project encompasses the entire process of model development, from initial data analysis to performance evaluation. 
It places particular emphasis on using both supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to analyze information about mobile phones.

### Project Structure
Initial Data Analysis: Review and exploration of the data to understand its structure and identify potential issues such as missing values or inconsistencies.
Data Preparation: Cleaning and transforming the data, including normalization, encoding categorical variables, and splitting into training and test sets.
Model Development: Implementation of two types of machine learning algorithms:
Decision Tree (supervised learning): Used to predict the prices of mobile phone models based on their features.
Hierarchical Clustering (unsupervised learning): Used to group mobile phone models into clusters based on their features, which can help identify similar groups of phones.
